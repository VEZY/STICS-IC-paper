# STICS-IC evaluation

This is the repository for the code and raw data of the paper entitled:

> Modelling bi-specific intercropping systems with the STICS soil-crop model: new formalisms and domain of validity

If you're interested in reproducing the simulations, you can head over the permanent Zenodo repository that has the optimized parameter values and a functioning JavaStics distribution with this version of the model, along with the output statistics and figures.

This repository contains the Pluto notebook that you can use to better understand how the radiative transfer computation works.
